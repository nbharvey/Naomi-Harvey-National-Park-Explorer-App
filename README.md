# National Parks Explorer

National Parks Explorer is a personal portfolio project designed to be your digital companion for exploring America's 63 designated National Parks. This application combines a passion for education, technology, and the great outdoors to build a digital experience that inspires adventure.

## Features

* **Interactive Maps:** Explore all 63 National Parks on an interactive map, powered by Leaflet. Discover park locations, details, and official websites at a glance.

* **Educational Games:** Test your knowledge with fun and engaging matching games. Match parks to their states or popular attractions in a drag-and-drop interface created with React DnD.

* **Curated Bookshelf:** Discover a library of books related to the National Parks. Filter by genre to find your next great read and add your own recommendations for others to see.

* **Database Integration:** User-specific data for features like the personal bookshelf is managed through a Spring Boot backend connected to a MySQL database, ensuring data is persistent and secure with full CRUD functionality.

* **Powered by Public Data:** All park information, including names, descriptions, and locations, is sourced directly from the official National Park Service (NPS) API.
